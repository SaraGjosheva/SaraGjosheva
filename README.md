# 👋 Hi there, I'm Sara Gjosheva 🚀

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

## About Me 👉
I'm a certified QA Engineer with a deep passion for software testing and a commitment to maintaining the highest quality standards in every project I work on. My expertise spans both manual and automated testing, with a particular focus on Selenium, which enables me to develop comprehensive test plans and execute test cases with precision.

In addition to my strong foundation in functional testing, I excel in performance testing, where I rigorously evaluate system responsiveness and scalability. I'm also proficient in REST API testing, using tools like Postman to ensure both functionality and performance are up to standard.

My ability to produce detailed bug reports contributes to the swift resolution of issues, helping teams deliver quality software on time. 

I am driven by a fervent passion for continuous learning and professional growth.

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a freelance manual tester on mobile apps. For [**Vantis | KHK und Herzinfarkt**](#), a health app for managing coronary heart disease and heart attack recovery, I focus on extensive manual testing, UI/UX optimization, and bug tracking to ensure a seamless user experience. Similarly, with [**Vantis | Bluthochdruck**](#), an app designed for high blood pressure management, my role includes rigorous feature validation, performance assessment, and quality assurance to enhance stability and effectiveness.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying to become a full-stack developer.
